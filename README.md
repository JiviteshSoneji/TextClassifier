# TextClassifier
In this Repository I have worked on Finetuning a Transformer Model (distilbert-base-uncased) for text Classification Task of the GLUE Benchmark. I have performed analysis on multiple metrics (Acuuracy, F1 Score, Matthew Correlation etc.) based on the relevance to the task. 

Since a pretrained model(DistilBertForSequenceClassification) was used I fine tuned it for my Classification task. Further Optimization of the model hyperparameters was done and the best model was stored.
